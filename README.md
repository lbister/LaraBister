# LaraBister

I am a PhD student at the Population Research Centre at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, and affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Germany. In the first steps of my scientific career, I did research on maternity leave and maternal health, life course approaches to adult health, and economic crises and family stress. I am an advanced Stata user and an intermediate R user. Happy to share my work here and get to know yours!
